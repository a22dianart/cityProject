    <p><p>Reykjavík is a interesting city with many monuments. Here I will only comment three of them.</p></p>
    <h2> Sun Voyager </h2>
    <p> The sun voyager is a sculpture by Jón Gunnar Árnason, located next to the Sæbraut road. Sun Voyager is described as a dreamboat, or an ode to the Sun. The artist intended it to convey the promise of undiscovered territory, a dream of hope, progress and freedom.</p>

    <h2> Imagine Peace Tower</h2>
    <p> The Imagine Peace Tower is a memorial to John Lennon from his widow, Yoko Ono, located on Viðey Island in Kollafjörður Bay. Installed in 2007, it consists of a tall tower of light, projected from a white stone monument that has the words "Imagine Peace" carved into it in 24 languages. These words, and the name of the tower, are a reference to Lennon's campaign for peace, and his song "Imagine".  </p>
