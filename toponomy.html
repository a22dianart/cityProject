    <p> Visitors to Iceland should notice very quickly that there are a lot of place names around this amazing island. The whole country is full of small towns and villages, and virtually every farmstead has a name. As you drive, bus, or bike around the island, you’ll notice signs bearing a multitude of place names, and many of them share particular prefixes, suffixes, and other words in common—terms that can tell you a lot about the places you’re visiting. If you spend enough time in Iceland and pay enough attention, you’re sure to figure out many of the words yourself. For many others, however, you’ll need to do some research.</p>
